6.1)	Done

6.2)	String inside a string:
	Line 7: print y
	Line 9: print "I said: %r." % x
	Line 10: print "I also said: '%s'." % y
	Line 15: print joke_evaluation % hilarious

6.3)	There are 6 print statements in the code, but only 4 of them has a string within a string. 
	The remaining 2 prints are as follows: 
	print x
	print w + e.

	"print x" only refers to an external number.
	"print w + e" prints a string after another, not a string within a string.

6.4)	The two variables are strings. When you add them together they make a longer line of text.
